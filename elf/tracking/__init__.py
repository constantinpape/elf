"""Graph-based tracking functionality. The currently available implementation is based on [motile](https://github.com/funkelab/motile).

For using this functionality, you have to install motile as an additional dependency.
An example for how to use `elf.tracking` can be found in [example/tracking](https://github.com/constantinpape/elf/tree/master/example/tracking).
