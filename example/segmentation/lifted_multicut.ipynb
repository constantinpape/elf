    "Use the `elf.segmentation` module for boundary **and prior** based lifted multicut segmentation: [Leveraging Domain Knowledge to Improve Microscopy Image Segmentation With Lifted Multicuts](https://doi.org/10.3389/fcomp.2019.00006).\n",
    "You can obtain the data from [here](https://oc.embl.de/index.php/s/kzdYaPlmr2NWCni).\n",
    "\n",
    "The segmentation approach works as follows:\n",
    "1. Predict pixel-wise boundary (or affinity) map. Here, we use pre-computed results from ilastik.\n",
    "2. Compute a watershed over-segmentation based on the boundary maps.\n",
    "3. Compute the region adjacency graph defined by the watershed over-segmentation.\n",
    "4. Compute weights for the edges of this graph by accumulating the boundary (or affinity) map over the edge pixels.\n",
    "5. Map the biological priors to watershed segments and use this to insert lifted edges.\n",
    "6. Partition the graph based on the local and lifted edge weights via Lifted Multicut and project the result back to the pixel level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we use the prior information that axonic and dendritic compartments should belong to seperate \n",
    "neurites in a constrained volume of mammalian neural tissue. We use probability maps trained to identify vesicles and dendritic shafts in order to attribute axon / dendrite labels to superpixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that the membrane probability maps used here do not correspond to the ones in the paper yet and are much worse than the ones we have used in there. Consequently, also the end result looks much worse than in the paper. I will try to update this data soon, still this example gives a good over-view in the steps involved to apply lifted multicut segmentation to your data."
